# AI-Fake-Content-Detector
AI Fake Content Detector identifies AI-generated content in text, documents, and images, providing confidence scores to help users verify authenticity quickly and reliably, supporting educators, content creators, and online platforms.
AI Fake Content Detector – Project Description

Introduction
AI-generated content is increasingly common in articles, reports, essays, presentations, and social media. While AI tools are useful for content creation, they also make it difficult to distinguish human-written content from AI-generated content. This can lead to misinformation, plagiarism, and misleading content, affecting students, educators, publishers, and online platforms. Manual verification is slow and impractical at scale.

The AI Fake Content Detector provides a fast, automated solution to identify AI-generated content across multiple formats, including text files, PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and images. By analyzing content and providing a confidence score, it helps users quickly assess authenticity. The system is implemented as a Kaggle notebook, allowing the community to test and interact with the tool directly.
